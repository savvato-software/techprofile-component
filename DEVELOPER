BUILDING A RELEASE
---
To build this project..

    # update the PATCH version number. unique version numbers prevent caching issues.
    rm dist/ -rf
    npm ci
    ng build dtim-techprofile-component
    cd dist/dtim-techprofile-component
    npm pack

Here's that command in one big line, if you're feeling frisky.

    cd projects/dtim-techprofile-component/ && npm version patch && cd - && rm dist/ -rf && ng build dtim-techprofile-component && cd dist/dtim-techprofile-component/ && npm pack && cd - && date

This will create a file, which you will have to refer to in the package.json of any other project that will make use of dtim-techprofile-component. Likely, this is already done for you. If you are just setting up your projects, don't worry about that. However, if you're reading this once you're comfortable with the code, and you've made a change to this repo, then you will need to know about this file, and that you may need to create a new version, and refer to that new version, in the other project. This is to avoid caching issues that prevent you from seeing your changes in the other project.

The file will be named
    ./dtim-techprofile-component/dist/dtim-techprofile-component/dtim-techprofile-component-0.0.?.tgz

    If it is already depended on by the other project, just change its version number to use your new changes.

    If it is not yet depended on by the other project, run this command to add it as a dependency
        npm install ./path/to/./dtim-techprofile-component/dist/dtim-techprofile-component/dtim-techprofile-component-0.0.?.tgz

    Notice the question mark in the path, you'd replace it with your version number.

PUBLISHING A NEW VERSION

    First login to npm with 'npm login'.
    Run the command above to build the library.
    From the root of the library, 'cd dist/dtim-techprofile-component && npm publish --dry-run'.
    Be sure the output of the dry run is referring to the correct version and code you just built.
    Run 'npm publish' when you are all sure.

    If you mess up, just release another version. But don't mess up.


Troubleshooting:
    is the service you added to this library not available in your client?
        - did you add it to public_api.ts?
